# CarbonCityBuilder
🌍 Freelance Project for Bionluk – Unity-Based Environmental Strategy Game
This Unity project features a 10x10 grid-based map, where players can interact with predefined clickable cells.
Through an intuitive UI window, players can place cities or structures by making selections for each grid tile.

Each structure impacts the environment by contributing to the overall carbon emission percentage.

🎯 Objective: Strategically place structures to reduce the total carbon emission to zero or below — all within one minute of gameplay.

This project was delivered as a freelance task via Bionluk and showcases dynamic UI interaction, environmental mechanics, and time-based strategic decision-making.
